Refer to the kaggle page for the data dictionary of this dataset

Note that this notebook is still a work-in-progress

Data exploration done in Tableau, see attached workbook for futher information.

Objective:\
This machine learning model is used to predict likelihood of credit card customer churning (attrition) using logistic regression.\
See the logreg function

The dataset from Kaggle is already clean, no data cleaning is required, only the standard preprocessing procedures (standard scaler, one-hot encoding).\
Need further investigations on other variables as features and improving model accuracy.\
The dataset is too bias towards existing customers.
